There are so many [probabilistic programming
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language#List_of_probabilistic_programming_languages) that
it is hard to choose one. Because it is so hard to choose one,
a probabilistic programmer has two options:

* invent a new probabilistic programming language, or
* write probabilistic programs in a regular programming
  language.

The former choice is easier to make, that's why there are so
many different probabilistic programming languages.  But writing
programs is so much easier in a regular language, and programs
in regular languages can do many useful things. Any modern
general-purpose programming language is suitable for
probabilistic programming. [Take Go, for
example](https://infergo.org).
