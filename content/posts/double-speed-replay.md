Thanks to the
[plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), we
teach over [Zoom](http://zoom.us/), and have our lectures
recorded. Many students do not attend in real time and instead
replay the recordings at their convenience, and at **2x speed**.

It is easy to label the students as superficial, but double
speed replay has a perfectly valid though slightly embarrassing,
for us the teachers, justification. When I was trained in public
speaking, I was taught this basic technique for preparing a
time-framed lecture:

* make up your mind and prepare visual aids if required,
* talk about the subject twice the time you are allocated and record yourself,
* transcribe your recorded speech and read it aloud, at a slow pace. 
* talk about the subject the second time, consulting the transcript if needed.

The result is that you normally get a smooth talk with the
correct duration (_half_ of the original time) the second time
around. This is because that when we speak about a subject
freely, even if we are well familiar with the subject, we spend
as much time thinking about what we are going to say next as
actually speaking (and conceal this by slowing down the overall
speaking pace). 

Let's admit that we do not do the full rehearsal of every
lecture we deliver. Because of that, we put the time burden of
thinking about what we are going to say on our students. And
students are smart enough to compensate for that by replaying at
2x speed --- actually at the _normal_ lecture speed if we came
prepared.
