From 2019 to 2022 I was a faculty member of the Computer Science
department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
Not anymore, but who knows what is around the corner.

## Research interests

My current research is related to the field of probabilistic
programming and Bayesian statistical modelling. In particular,
I am  interested in defining the kinds of models  which can
be efficiently represented and reasoned upon by means of
probabilistic programming, on one hand, and in application of
probabilistic programming to other areas, such as computational
health, robotics, or human-computer interaction, on the other
hand.
