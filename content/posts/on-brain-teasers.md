title: "On Brain Teasers at Job Interviews"

I went to a few job interviews during past weeks. Most interviewers asked me to
tell about problems I had solved, and to suggest a solution to a problem they
really needed to solve. Some though offered me to solve brain teasers —
problems they (or others) invented to test candidates. I solved most, but I
felt bad about it. I can imagine many bright candidates who would fail an
interview because of brain teasers.

Brain teasers are wrong — that’s my gut feeling, but I had hard time finding an
argument to support my gut feeling. Now I have one. Here is the story of a 250
years old job interview.

> Yechezkel Landau, the rabbi of Prague in the second half of the 18th
> century and a famous Jewish scholar, applied for the post when he was only
> 41. Local Jewish intellectual elite gave him a tough examination on the
> jewish law. The candidate had to analyse and resolve difficult case
> studies, and provide rulings for complicated situations.
> 
> Rabbi Yechezkel answered all questions except for one. But though he failed
> to solve one particular riddle, he showed clearly that the riddle was not a
> real case but a thought-up one, with the sole purpose to humiliate the
> candidate.
> 
> Rabbi Yechezkel said that human wisdom is divine, and because it is divine
> it only acts in real, God-inspired, situations. When presented with an
> artificial problem, constructed by one human just to test another human,
> the wisest thought is no better than a random guess.

Brain teasers are bad for job interviews. They are no better than choosing a
candidate by throwing a coin.

Rabbi Yechezkel got the job, by the way.
