I am a visiting faculty member of the Computer Science
department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
This means that I advise research students and collaborate on
research, but am not get paid by the university. Everyone is
happy.

## Research interests

My current research is related to the field of probabilistic
programming and Bayesian statistical modelling. In particular,
I am  interested in defining the kinds of models  which can
be efficiently represented and reasoned upon by means of
probabilistic programming, on one hand, and in application of
probabilistic programming to other areas, such as computational
health, robotics, or human-computer interaction, on the other
hand. 

## Publications

My publications are on [Google
scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=di9-aTh2Qk0C).  Some recent
publications on probabilistic programming:

* Probabilistic programs with stochastic conditioning [pmlr](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/tolpin21a.html), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00282)
* Deployable probabilistic programming [acm](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3359727), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11199)

* Black-box policy search with probabilistic programs [pmlr](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/vandemeent16.html)

## Teaching

From 2019 to 2021, I had taught two courses at the department.

* Applied Bayesian Data Analysis --- [course site](https://bgu-abda.bitbucket.io/), [recorded lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmVzOcgiXjA&list=PLyCpIuhZg8qCPIJNa9SQ65sfsBmiBaMqz).
* Applications of Mathematics in Computer Science --- [course site](https://bgu-macs.bitbucket.io/), [recorded lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHMWIhd22U&list=PLyCpIuhZg8qA1MQrAqnqAvXJrvLSFbxF6).

## Ongoing projects

* [Infergo](http://infergo.org/) --- a probabilistic programming
  facility in Go.
* [GoGP](http://bitbucket.org/dtolpin/gogp) --- a library on
  probabilistic programming around Gaussian processes.
