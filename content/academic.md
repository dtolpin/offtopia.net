I am a faculty member of the Computer Science department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.

## Research interests

My current research is related to the field of probabilistic
programming and Bayesian statistical modelling. In particular,
I am  interested in defining the kinds of models  which can
be efficiently represented and reasoned upon by means of
probabilistic programming, on one hand, and in application of
probabilistic programming to other areas, such as computational
health, robotics, or human-computer interaction, on the other
hand. 

## Publications

My publications are on [Google
scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=di9-aTh2Qk0C).  Some recent
publications on probabilistic programming:

* Deployable probabilistic programming [acm](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3359727), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11199)
* Design and implementation of probabilistic programming language Anglican [acm](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3064910), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05263)
* Black-box policy search with probabilistic programs [jmlr](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/vandemeent16.html)

## Ongoing projects

* [Infergo](http://infergo.org/) --- a probabilistic programming
  facility in Go.
* [GoGP](http://bitbucket.org/dtolpin/gogp) --- a library on
  probabilistic programming around Gaussian processes.
